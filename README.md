# Superusers & Ev Adoption in the USA
This Project was created to provide quantitative insights for the white paper 'Gasoline Superusers' (M. Metz. J. London, P. Roesler) and contains three main parts:
1) Superusers analysis (Python)
2) EV Adoption Policy Model (Excel)
3) Emission Pathways Gasoline Consumption Groups Model (Excel)


## Superusers
This analysis highlights the importance of Light-Duty-Vehicle gasoline superuser targeted policies for emission reduction in the transportation sector.

To analyze Superusers characteristics, data was taken from the National Household Survey from NHTS 2017 (https://nhts.ornl.gov/).

The nhts.py files contain data import, cleaning, analysis and graph prepping (graphing was done later on in excel) of the nhts datasets on the vehicles and person level.
Additionally, we provide code on scraped state level vehicle registration panel data from the fhwa highway statistics (highway_statistics.py) and EV registration panel data (ev_registrations.py). 
Some parts of the analysis and code were not used in the paper itself, however, are included in this project.
To model the impact of policies on profiteers of a policy, profiteer_models.py was created.



## EV Adoption Models
The folder EV Adoption contains the model for the analysis of different EV adoption policies. Consumption Groups contains files related to the model and the model itself.
In order to evaluate emissions related to different adoption paths of gasoline consumers organized in deciles a model was created and can be found in the folder Consumption Groups.
