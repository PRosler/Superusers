# Superusers
The target of the project is to analyse the importance of superuser target policies for emission reduction in transportation sector.

Data was taken from the National Household Surver from NHTS 2017 (https://nhts.ornl.gov/).

The nhts.py files contain data import, cleaning, analysis and graph prepping (graphing was done later on in excel) of the nhts datasets on the vehicles and person level.
To model the impact of policies on profiteers, profiteer_models.py was created.
In order to evaluate emissions related to different adoption paths of gsoline consumumers organized in deciles, Model_USA.xlsx was created.

Additionally we provide code on scraped state level vehicle registration panel data from the fhwa highway statistics and EV registration panel data.
