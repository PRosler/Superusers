# Superusers & Ev Adoption in the USA
This Project was created to provide quantitative insights for the white paper 'Gasoline Superusers' (M. Metz. J. London, P. Roesler) and contains three main parts:
1) Superusers analysis (Python)
2) EV Adoption Policy Model (Excel)
3) Emission Pathways Gasoline Consumption Groups Model (Excel)


## Superusers
The target of the project is to analyse the importance of Light-Duty-Vehicle gasoline superuser targeted policies for emission reduction in the transportation sector.

To analyze Superusers characteristics, data was taken from the National Household Survey from NHTS 2017 (https://nhts.ornl.gov/).

The nhts.py files contain data import, cleaning, analysis and graph prepping (graphing was done later on in excel) of the nhts datasets on the vehicles and person level.
To model the impact of policies on profiteers, profiteer_models.py was created.
In order to evaluate emissions related to different adoption paths of gsoline consumers organized in deciles, Model_USA.xlsx was created.

Additionally we provide code on scraped state level vehicle registration panel data from the fhwa highway statistics and EV registration panel data. 

## EV Adoption Models
The folder EV Adoption contains the most relevant documents for the analysis of different EV adoption policies. Consumption Groups contains files related to the model and the model itself.
